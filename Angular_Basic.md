# Angular Basic 

- Created by google
- Single Page application
- Type Script based

## Imports 
1. Module (Anuglar module or features)
2. Component or Searvice which we have created

- node_modules contain another modules i have to use 

## How to use Modules
- Install on system (nmp install module-name)
- Import in our system (App.module.ts or Specific componenet)
- Use module 
- app.module.ts => Globally accessible

- Only need to import in app.module no need to import everywhere
- Always import in app.module its good design

## Why styles and scripts in angular.json
- Styles are global its better to have them seperate 
- Scripts are not all available in moudules so keep them sperate like (jquery)
